This purpose of this C# class library is to calculate the optimal shipping amount for a given sales order. 
‘Optimal’ in this case means the most expensive shipping rate that meets the criteria of a given sales order. 


There are 3 types of shipping rates that can apply:
•	Weight based: applicable if the sales order is within a specified weight range
•	Price based: applicable if the sales order is within a specified price range
•	API based: Simulates a 3rd party API to calculate a shipping rate - applicable if the sales order is within as specified weight range


Your goal is to complete the ShippingCalculator.Calculate() method. This method should return the shipping amount as a decimal value.


You are also expected to create the necessary unit tests to provide full coverage of the shipping calculator.


Before starting, ensure you review all the properties of the Database classes, taking note of important fields that may be required. 
Record any assumptions in a comment at the top of the ShippingCalculator class.
